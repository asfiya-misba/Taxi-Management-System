# Taxi-Management-System

A database management system project using MySQL, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript

The aim of this application is to reduce the manual effort needed to manage transactions in a taxi company.
The application provides an interface for users to book a taxi, view the details of the taxi, price per Km, manage his/her profile, and give feedbacks.
An admin manages the bookings, vehicles, brands and the feedbacks given by the user.
This will be demonstrated by a simple web page for the frontend interactions.
